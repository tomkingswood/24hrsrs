    question: "How often should my stairlift be serviced?",
    answer: "We recommend having your stairlift serviced at least once a year. Regular servicing helps prevent breakdowns, extends the life of your stairlift, and ensures it's safe to use. If your stairlift is used frequently, you may benefit from more regular servicing."
